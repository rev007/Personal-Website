### About ###

This project is an overhaul of my old site which is now broken. Improvements will include the following:

* Fix the responsiveness by combining CSS Grid and Flexbox Layout
* Implement an interactive solution that works using a mouse or touchscreen
* Write compliant and maintainable code
* Create a pleasing aesthetic (color palette, typography, etc.)
* Introduce a memorable experience through the use of animation
  
### How to Run ###
